I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science and Technology at Xi’an Jiaotong University. I hold a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Lanzhou University. I am qualified as a Senior Engineer, and have obtained certifications as an Intermediate Software Designer and Senior System Analyst.

With 18 years of experience in banking software development and information technology management, my research focuses on artificial intelligence and machine learning, with applications in intelligent risk control and precision marketing within the banking sector.
